\begin{defn*}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a finite edge-weighted bipartite planar graph with a set {\bf N} of $2n$ special vertices called nodes on the outer face labeled $1, 2, \ldots, 2n$ in counterclockwise order. A double-dimer configuration on $(\mathcal{G}, {\bf N})$ is a configuration of disjoint loops, doubled edges, and simple paths that connect the nodes in pairs. Each configuration is weighted by the product of its edge-weights times $2^{\ell}$, where $\ell$ is the number of loops in the configuration.
\end{defn*}



\begin{defn*}
Let $\mathcal{G}^{BW}$ be the subgraph of $\mathcal{G}$ formed by deleting the nodes except for the ones that are black and odd or white and even. Let $\mathcal{G}^{BW}_{i, j}$ be defined as $\mathcal{G}^{BW}$ was, but with node $i$ included in $\mathcal{G}^{BW}_{i, j}$ if and only if it was not included in $\mathcal{G}^{BW}$, and similarly for node $j$. Let $Z^{BW}$ and $Z^{BW}_{i, j}$ be the weighted sum of dimer configurations of dimer configurations of $\mathcal{G}^{BW}$ and $\mathcal{G}^{BW}_{i, j}$, respectively. Define $Z^{WB}$ and $Z^{WB}_{i, j}$ similarly but with the roles of black and white reversed.
\end{defn*}


For each planar matching of the nodes $\sigma$, let $\text{Pr}(\sigma)$ be the probability that a random double-dimer configuration has pairing $\sigma$. Kenyon and Wilson showed that assuming all of the nodes are black and odd or white and even,  $\widehat{ \text{Pr} }(\sigma) := \text{Pr}(\sigma) \dfrac{ Z^{WB}}{Z^{BW}}$ is an integer coefficient  polynomial in the quantities $X_{i, j} := Z^{BW}_{i, j}/Z^{BW}$.


\begin{note*}
They assume that all odd nodes of $\mathcal{G}$ are black and all even nodes are white.
\end{note*}

\begin{defn*}
If $S$ is a balanced subset of nodes, that is, a subset containing an equal number $k$ of white and black nodes. Let $Z^{D}(S) = Z^{D}( \mathcal{G} \setminus S)$ be the weighted sum of dimer covers of $\mathcal{G} \setminus S$. Let $S^{c} = {\bf N} \setminus S$.
\end{defn*}

\begin{lemma*} [Lemma 3.1, KW 2006]
$Z^{D}(S) Z^{D}(S^{c})$ is a sum of double-dimer configurations for all connection topologies $\pi$ for which $\pi$ connects no element of $S$ to an element of $S^{c}$. That is,
$$Z^{D}(S) Z^{D}(S^{c}) = Z^{DD} \sum\limits_{\pi} M_{S, \pi} \Pr (\pi)$$
where $M_{S, \pi}$ is 0 or 1 according to whether $\pi$ connects nodes in $S$ to $S^{c}$ or not.
\end{lemma*}

Let $G$ be a graph with node set ${\bf N}$ that does not necessarily have the property that odd nodes of $\mathcal{G}$ are black and all even nodes are white. Let $M \subseteq N$ be the set of nodes that are odd and white or even and black.
Let $\tilde{G}$ be $G$ with an extra vertex and edge with weight 1 added to each node in $M$. So all of the nodes in $\tilde{G}$ are black and odd or white and even.

Additionally, assume that $G$ has an equal number of black and white nodes and $\tilde{G}$ has an equal number of black and white nodes. These two assumptions imply that $M$ is a balanced subset. Note that
$$Z^{D}(\tilde{G} \setminus S) = Z^{D}(G \setminus (S \cap M^{c} ) \cup (M \cap S^{c}) )$$

Then Lemma 3.1 says that

\begin{cor*}[Corollary to Lemma 3.1]
Let $S$ be a balanced subset of nodes. \\
$Z^{D}(G \setminus (S \cap M^{c} ) \cup (M \cap S^{c})) Z^{D}(G \setminus (S^{c} \cap M^{c} ) \cup (M \cap S))$ is a sum of double-dimer configurations for all connection topologies $\pi$ for which $\pi$ connects no element of $S$ to an element of $S^{c}$. That is,
$$Z^{D}(G \setminus (S \cap M^{c} ) \cup (M \cap S^{c})) Z^{D}(G \setminus (S^{c} \cap M^{c} ) \cup (M \cap S)) = Z^{DD}(G) \sum\limits_{\pi} M_{S, \pi} \Pr (\pi)$$
where $M_{S, \pi}$ is 0 or 1 according to whether $\pi$ connects nodes in $S$ to $S^{c}$ or not.
\end{cor*}

If $T = (S \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap S^{c})$, then $S = (T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c})$, so:

\begin{cor*}[Corollary to Lemma 3.1]
Let $T$ be a balanced subset of nodes.
$Z^{D}(T) Z^{D}(T^{c})$ is a sum of all connection topologies $\pi$ for which $\pi$ connects no elements of $(T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c})$ to $\left((T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c})\right)^{c}$. That is
$$Z^{D}(G \setminus T) Z^{D}(G \setminus T^{c}) = Z^{DD}(G) \sum\limits_{\pi} M_{(T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c}), \pi} \Pr (\pi)$$
where $M_{(T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c}), \pi}$ is 0 or 1 depending on whether $\pi$ connects nodes in $(T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c})$ to $\left((T \cap M^{c}) \cup (M \cap T^{c})\right)^{c}$.
\end{cor*}

Assuming that $\mathcal{G}$ has the property that the odd-numbered nodes are black and the even-numbered nodes are white, Kenyon and Wilson prove the following. 

\begin{lemma*}[Lemma 3.2, KW 2006]
Let $S$ be a balanced subset of $\{1, \ldots, 2n\}$. Then
$$\dfrac{Z^{D}(S) Z^{D}(S^{c})}{(Z^{D})^{2}} = 
\det[(1_{i, j \in S} + 1_{i, j \notin S}) \times (-1)^{(|i - j| -1)/2} X_{i, j} ]^{i = 1, 3, \ldots, 2n-1}_{j = 2, 4, \ldots, 2n}$$
\end{lemma*}

If we do not assume that $\mathcal{G}$ has the property that the odd-numbered nodes are black and the even-numbered nodes are white, we have the following conjecture:

\begin{conj*}
Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a bipartite planar graph with set of nodes $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$. Let $S$ be a balanced subset of $\{1, \ldots, 2n\}$. Then 
$$\dfrac{Z^{D}(\mathcal{G} \setminus S) Z^{D}(\mathcal{G} \setminus S^{c})}{(Z^{D}(\mathcal{G})^{2}} = 
\det \left[(1_{i, j \in S} + 1_{i, j \notin S}) \times \text{sign}(i, j, S) \dfrac{Z^{D}(\mathcal{G}_{i, j})}{Z^{D}(\mathcal{G})} \right]^{i = b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n}_{j = w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n}$$
where $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ are the black nodes of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$ listed in ascending order,$w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ are the white nodes of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2n\}$ listed in ascending order, and $\text{sign}(i, j, S) = 1$ or $-1$ depending on $i, j,$ and $S$. 
\end{conj*}

\begin{proof}
Let $K$ be a Kasteleyn matrix of $\mathcal{G}$. Then the signs of the edges $\mathcal{G}$ are so that there are an odd number of $-$ signs if the face has 0 mod 4 edges and an even number of $-$ signs if the face has 2 mod 4 edges. 
Let $(w_1, b_1), \ldots, (w_k, b_k)$ be any noncrossing pairing of the nodes of $S$, where $w_1, \ldots, w_k$ are the white nodes of $S$ and $b_1, \ldots b_k$ are the black nodes of $S$ (such a noncrossing pairing always exists since $S$ is a balanced subset). 
Adjoin edges $e_i$ of weight $W$ to the outer face connecting $w_i$ to $b_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq k$. (What if two nodes are adjacent, and doing this creates a multigraph?). We claim that we can choose a weight for each $e_i$ that retains the Kasteleyn sign condition. 

To see this, first observe that adjoining the edge $e_1$ creates exactly two new faces, since $w_1$ and $b_1$ are on the outer face (i.e. the face bounding the infinite region) of $\mathcal{G}$. Let $p$ and $q$ be the two paths from $w_1$ to $b_1$ consisting of edges along the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$. Observe that $p$ and $q$ must both have odd length, since $w_1$ and $b_1$ are different colors. There are two different cases, depending on whether the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 0 mod 4 edges or 2 mod 4 edges. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 0 mod 4 edges. \\
When the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 0 mod 4 edges, one of the paths $p$ or $q$ must have length $4 \ell + 1$ for some $\ell$ and the other path must have length $4 j + 3$ for some $j$. Assume without loss of generality that $p$ has length $4 \ell + 1$ for some $\ell$. Since the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 0 mod 4 edges, the product of the signs of the edges of the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ is $-1$. This means that either the product of the signs of the edges of $p$ is 1 and the product of the signs of the edges of $q$ is $-1$, or the product of the signs of the edges of $p$ is $-1$ and the product of the signs of the edges of $q$ is $1$. So there are two cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The product of the signs of the edges of $p$ is $1$. \\
Since the face bounded by the path $p$ and the edge $e_1$ has 2 mod 4 edges, give $e_1$ sign $1$. Then since the product of the signs of the edges of $q$ is $-1$, the face bounded by the path $q$ and the edge $e_1$ has 0 mod 4 edges and an odd number of $-$ signs.
\item The product of the signs of the edges of $p$ is $-1$.\\
Since the face bounded by the path $p$ and the edge $e_1$ has 2 mod 4 edges, give $e_1$ sign $-1$. Then since the product of the signs of the edges of $q$ is 1, the face bounded by the path $q$ and the edge $e_1$ has 0 mod 4 edges and an odd number of $-$ signs. 
\end{enumerate}
\item The outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 2 mod 4 edges. 
When the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 2 mod 4 edges, either both $p$ and $q$ have length 1 mod 4 or both $p$ and $q$ have length 3 mod 4. 
Since the outer face of $\mathcal{G}$ has 2 mod 4 edges, the outer face has an even number of $-$ signs. This means that either both $p$ and $q$ have an even number of $-$ signs or both $p$ and $q$ have an odd number of minus signs. So there are several cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ and $q$ have length 1 mod 4
In this case, both the face bounded by the path $p$ and the edge $e_1$ and the face bounded by the path $q$ and the edge $e_1$ have 2 mod 4 edges. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ and $q$ both have an even number of $-$ signs
Give $e_1$ sign $1$. Then both new faces have an even number of $-$ signs. 
\item $p$ and $q$ both have an odd number of $-$ signs
Give $e_1$ sign $-1$. Then both new faces have an even number of $-$ signs. 
\end{enumerate}
\item $p$ and $q$ have length 3 mod 4
In this case, both the face bounded by the path $p$ and the edge $e_1$ and the face bounded by the path $q$ and the edge $e_1$ have 0 mod 4 edges. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ and $q$ both have an even number of $-$ signs
Give $e_1$ sign $-1$. Then both new faces have an odd number of $-$ signs. 
\item $p$ and $q$ both have an odd number of $-$ signs
Give $e_1$ sign $1$. Then both new faces have an odd number of $-$ signs. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
So in all cases we have chosen the sign for $e_1$ so that the resulting graph still satisfies the Kasteleyn sign condition. By induction, we can add choose a sign for each $e_i$ so that the resulting graph satisfies the Kasteleyn sign condition. Let $K_{W}$ be the matrix defined as follows: $(K_{W})_{s, t} = \text{sign}(e_i) W$ if $(s, t) = (w_{i}, b_{i})$ for some $i$, and $(K_{W})_{s, t} = (K)_{s, t}$ otherwise. By construction, if $K_{0} := K_{W} |_{W = 0}$, then $K_0 = K$. 
 Reorder the columns of $K_{W}$ so that $w_1, \ldots, w_k$ are the first $k$ rows and $b_1, \ldots, b_k$ are the first $k$ columns. Since $K$ is a Kasteleyn matrix of $G$ and we chose signs of $e_i$ to retain the Kasteleyn sign condition, $Z^{D}(\mathcal{G} \setminus S) = \pm [W^{k}] \det(K_{W})$. 
We see that
$$\dfrac{ Z^{D}(\mathcal{G} \setminus S)}{Z^{D}(\mathcal{G})} = \dfrac{ [W^{k}] \det(K_{W}) }{[W^{0}] \det K_{W}}$$
Then
$$ \dfrac{ [W^{k}] \det(K_{W}) }{[W^{0}] \det K_{W}} = \pm \dfrac{ \det K_{\setminus S} }{ \det K }$$
how to determine sign here?
Not sure why any of this is necessary if I can't keep track of the sign. 
is $Z^{D}(\mathcal{G} \setminus S) = \pm \det (K_{\setminus S})$? Maybe not because although both $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G} \setminus S$ have Kasteleyn matrices, if we let $K$ be the Kasteleyn matrix for $\mathcal{G}$, its not necessarily the case that the Kasteleyn matrix for $\mathcal{G} \setminus S$ is $K_{\setminus S}$. 

\end{proof}

Recall that the cross of a pairing is a set of two parts ${a, c}$ and ${b, d}$ of $\rho$ such that $a < b < c < d$. 
Kenyon and Wilson define the parity of an odd-even pairing $\rho = ((1, w_1), (3, w_2), \ldots, (2n-1, w_n))$ to be the parity of the permutation $(w_1/2)(w_2/2)\ldots(w_n/n)$. Then they prove the following

\begin{lemma*}[Lemma 3.4, KW 2006]
For odd-even pairings $\rho$, 
$$(-1)^{\text{parity of } \rho} \prod\limits_{(i, j) \in \rho} (-1)^{(|i-j|-1)/2} = (-1)^{\# \text{ crosses of } \rho}$$
\end{lemma*}

Any pairing on $2n$ elements $\rho$ can be written $\rho = ((i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), \ldots, (i_n, j_n))$ so that $i_k < j_k$ for all $k$ and $i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_n$. We define $\sgn(\rho)$ to be the parity of the permutation $j_1 j_2 \ldots j_n$, when $j_1, \ldots j_n$ are relabeled with the labels $1, \ldots, n$ so that $\min_{1 \leq k \leq n} \{j_{k} \}$ is relabeled 1, $\ldots$, $\max_{1 \leq k \leq n} \{j_{k} \}$ is relabeled $n$.

\begin{conj*}
For any pairing $\rho$, 
$$\sgn(\rho) \prod\limits_{(i, j) \in \rho} f(i, j) =  (-1)^{\# \text{ crosses of } \rho}$$
where $f(i, j)$ is defined as follows: 
$$f(i, j) = \begin{cases} 
(-1)^{(|i-j| -1)/2} & \mbox{ if $i, j$ are different parity} \\
(-1)^{|i-j|/2} & \mbox{if $i, j$ are both odd} \\
(-1)^{(|i-j|-2)/2} & \mbox{if $i, j$ are both even} \\
\end{cases}$$
\end{conj*}

\begin{note*}
This conjecture has been checked for all pairings on 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 elements. 
\end{note*}
